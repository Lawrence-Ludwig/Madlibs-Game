Python Project Worksheet
 
Output: Your goal
You will write a program that asks a user to fill in a story. Store each response in a variable, then print the story based on the responses.

Part 1: Plan and Write the Pseudocode
Use the following guidelines to write your pseudocode for a fill-in story program.

Decide on a list of items the program will ask the user to input.
Your program should include at least four interactive prompts.
Input from the user should be assigned to variables and used in the story.
Use concatenation to join strings together in the story.
Print the story for the user to read.
